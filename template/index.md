## Making a TinyProfile is easy!

- Rename your folder from `template` to what you want your TinyProfile user url to be. So if you want it to appear as `tinyprofile.me/janedoe`, then name your folder `janedoe`.
- Replace `profile.jpg` with a photo of you! This should be in JPEG format, square and smaller than 1MB
- If you want to designate a background image, replace `background.jpg` your own image. Please keep the image under 1MB. Note that this image will be scaled and cropped differently on different devices, so choose an image that doesn't have a strong focal point because it might get lost
- If you don't want a background image and you just want a solid color, delete the file `background.jpg`
- Next in `index.md` edit the data at the top of the file. This is what tells the site what to display. The comments should help you figure out what each entry is. Keep the formatting reasonably the same.
- Now replace this text starting with `## Making a TinyProfile is easy!` with a short blurb about you!
    - You can use markdown to help with formatting if you want something a little extra
- FINALLY, when you're happy, zip up the folder and email the whole thing to tinyprofile@gmail.com

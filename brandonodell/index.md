I'm Brandon. You can usually find me hiking the mountains of Los Angeles, but when I'm not enjoying the great outdoors I am working in the Product field. I specialize in a variety of different areas including end-to-end user experience and research. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my work or if you need a recommendation. Or if you want to grab a green juice sometime.

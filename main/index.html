It's 💯% free

### 😎 What is this?

TinyProfile is a place for a simple, no nonsense website to promote yourself and
connect all your social accounts. Building a website is too hard and often too
expensive for a lot of us, so make a TinyProfile instead!

Take a look at an example: <a href="/jbergen">jbergen</a>, also, this page is a TinyProfile!

### 💡 Who is this for?

TinyProfile is for anyone who needs or wants a personal website to share with contacts or on their
resume that doesn't have the time, money, or need for anything bigger. You might just
need to link all your social sites and add a little blurb 🔥

### 💸 How much does TinyProfile cost?

***TinyProfile is free!***

If you want to leave a tip I wouldn't say no 🙏
<a href="https://www.paypal.me/jlbergen" target="blank">PayPal</a>

### 🧪 How do I make a TinyProfile?

Fill out this <a href="http://bit.ly/2WBm9ag">form</a>. We will make every
effort to have it go live asap, but since it's a manual process it might take up to 24 hours.
We'll email when it's live!

### 📝 How do I edit my TinyProfile?

Just go back to the <a href="http://bit.ly/2WBm9ag">form</a> and edit your
response and resubmit it! It might take up to 24 hours before the update goes live however.

### 🤬 I've submitted the form or update and I don't see any update!!

Give us a little time to keep up, but if it's been more than 24 hours just email
**tinyprofile@gmail.com** and we'll take a look.

### ✋ What are the limitations?

In order to keep costs to a minimum we're using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="blank">Jekyll</a>
with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="blank">Github pages</a> which means that there
is currently no way for users to have user accounts in the traditional sense. So if you need
to make edits or change your photo the process requires a little bit of manually updating. If you're familiar with github, you can easily submit a 
pull request with your updates. However, we expect that these will be mostly set and forget.

If you need something more, take a look at SquareSpace or Wix for solid, attractive site builders,
but they ain't free…
